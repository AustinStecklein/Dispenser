Images.py has to stay in the same folder as main because if it was in the images folder everything in the modules and pages folders would not be able to access those images
The Subpages for Settings do not lower when the home button is pressed
Keyboard has the home screen attached to it

Add Button to close unit selector in case the user accidently pressed it


Not the Image Problem:
Where the files are located
Does not matter how the image is declared within the button or label object i.e. image = Images.get('ex'), or image = example_image
Not an issue with the Settings Pages
nothing to do with spaces in the image names
not because of the NONE, variable in the file location
sys path crashes
