Add Button to close unit selector in case the user accidently pressed it


Not the Image Problem:
Where the files are located
Does not matter how the image is declared within the button or label object i.e. image = Images.get('ex'), or image = example_image
Not an issue with the Settings Pages
nothing to do with spaces in the image names
not because of the NONE, variable in the file location
sys path crashes
